Project Report: Railway Crossing Gate Control System
Project Overview
This project focuses on the design and implementation of a simplified railway crossing gate control system using Verilog HDL. The primary objective is to enhance safety at railway-road intersections by automatically managing the gate and warning signals based on real-time train detection across multiple tracks.

Introduction
The "Railway Crossing Gate Control System" is a Verilog-based digital logic project that simulates an automated safety mechanism for railway crossings. The system monitors four tracks (rail_A, rail_B, rail_C, rail_D) and uses sensor inputs to determine gate and signal light status.

When a train is detected on any track:

The gate is closed

A red warning light is activated

When no train is present:

The gate remains open

The warning light is off

This project emulates a real-world application of FSM-based automation in transportation safety systems.

Tasks Completed
✅ 1. FSM Design & Implementation
Two-state FSM:

1'b0 – Gate Open (No train detected)

1'b1 – Gate Closed (Train detected on any track)

✅ 2. Signal Definitions
Inputs:

rail_A, rail_B, rail_C, rail_D – Train detection inputs

reset – System reset

enable – Enables system operation

Outputs:

gate – Gate status (1 = closed, 0 = open)

red_light – Red light indicator (1 = on, 0 = off)

✅ 3. Logic Control
Next state determined based on the presence of a train.

Gate and light outputs update accordingly.

✅ 4. Testbench Creation
Simulated train arrivals and departures on all tracks.

Verified correct state transitions and outputs (gate, light).

Verilog Code Summary

// Simplified FSM for train detection
if (enable) begin
  if (rail_A | rail_B | rail_C | rail_D)
    next_state = 1; // Train detected
  else
    next_state = 0; // No train
end
Output logic:

Edit
gate = (current_state == 1);      // Close gate if train detected
red_light = (current_state == 1); // Turn on red light
Results
✔️ The gate closes and red light activates when a train is detected on any track.
✔️ The gate opens and light deactivates when all tracks are clear.
✔️ Testbench successfully validated all scenarios using waveform simulation.
